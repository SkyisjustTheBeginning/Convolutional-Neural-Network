# Convolutional-Neural-Network
A Convolutional Neural Network designed to classify dog and cat images.

What is a Convolution Neural Network ?

A Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) is a class of artificial neural networks that are most commonly used to analyse images.However,These networks can also be used for text classification.

Our CNN Model will be able to classify dog and cat images.

This model will be built using Keras and will be trained using my own dataset.
